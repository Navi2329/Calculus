# Calculus
Python Code to find derivative of a function
#13/08/20
*CODE COMPLETED TILL LOGARITHM AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
*There is a need to give diff in front of every input
*comp is not required for log and exp functions
*sympify() function is replaced with simplify() function
*All trignometric fucntions will work perfrctly
*modulus function added
*tan inverse function added
#14/08/20
*All inverse functions are added
*Derivative at a point can be calculated
*there is no method to control the range of deriavtive
*The PROGRAM MAY RETURN IMAGINARY VALUES FOR DERIVATIVES AT A POINT
#18/08/20
*ALL TYPES OF FUNCTIONS ARE DONE
**CODE FOR FUNCTIONS TO THE POWER IS COMPLETED
#6/09/20
*Code for parsing was added for all functions except exponential function.
#14/09/20
*Parsing for exponential function was added
*Differentiability and existence of a function is now checked
*Inverse trignometric function were named according to sympy
#28/09/20
*Equation of normal and tangents will now check if a function is existing at that point
#30/09/20
*Graphs of the function,derivative,tangent and normal was added
#5/10/20
*Graphs of exponential functions works now
#21/11/20
*History feature is added
*minor changes in choices
*if error:gedit-no such file or directory,
   rename gedit to notepad
#23/11/20
*startfile in os module was added to tackle errors in windows
*from sympy import * was changed to import the needed functions individually(simplify,plot,zoo,N)
******Decorations to code to be done******
#03/12/20 and 04/12/20
*removable discontinuity was added using limits(03/12/20)
*A choice to calculate limit of a function was added(04/12/20)
#06/12/20
*Issue regarding Applications regarding exponential function was fixed.
*imported new module of sympy named plot_explicit to plot vertical tangents.
*Imported sys library to tackle break issue when running nested loop(sys.exit()).
*Imported warnings library to skip warnings given by sympy.
*Changed the code so that the while loop will ask for choice and not to start input_handler() from beginning when the entered function is not defined/differentiable at a point.
*Some errors in equation of tangents and normals when the code misinterprets variable 'c' as choice instead of the calculated constant value of the equation.
*Errors when calculating limits at x values (when expressed as pi) were fixed
*Some limits if inverse trignometric functions were giving errors(!!!!!!!!!!!!)
*History.txt was uploaded to check list of already typed functions
*Reduced the number of lines by a minimum of 20 lines
#07/12/20
*Added 2 choices to check continuity and differentiability
