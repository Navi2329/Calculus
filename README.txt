# Calculus
Python Code to find derivative of a function
#13/08/20
*CODE COMPLETED TILL LOGARITHM AND EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS
*There is a need to give diff in front of every input
*comp is not required for log and exp functions
*sympify() function is replaced with simplify() function
*All trignometric fucntions will work perfrctly
*modulus function added
*tan inverse function added
#14/08/20
*All inverse functions are added
*Derivative at a point can be calculated
*there is no method to control the range of deriavtive
*The PROGRAM MAY RETURN IMAGINARY VALUES FOR DERIVATIVES AT A POINT
#18/08/20
*ALL TYPES OF FUNCTIONS ARE DONE
**CODE FOR FUNCTIONS TO THE POWER IS COMPLETED
#6/09/20
*Code for parsing was added for all functions except exponential function.
#14/09/20
*Parsing for exponential function was added
*Differentiability and existence of a function is now checked
*Inverse trignometric function were named according to sympy
#28/09/20
*Equation of normal and tangents will now check if a function is existing at that point
#30/09/20
*Graphs of the function,derivative,tangent and normal was added
